## Purpose of the application

The purpose of this app is to help users to keep an account of their daily food choices. Users have a possibility to add foods to their diary and receive information about the nutritional value of both individual foods and their overall consumption per day or over a longer period of time.

## Users

First there will be only one type of users, who have access to basic functions required to keeping a food diary. Later, there is a possibility to add an admin type of user with broader user rights.

## Basic functionality

### Before logging in

- user can create an account
  - unique username
- user can determine the daily goal for calorie intake by filling in a form
- user can log into the system
  - logging in by typing username to a form
  - if the username is not found, system shows an alert message

### After logging in

- user can see the personal food collection
  - user can see only the collection associated to the user
  - foods are shown by their date in a list, latest dates first
- user can add foods with their nutritional value
- user can add a food to the collection
  - user adds the nutritional information per 100 grams and how much was eaten
  - the nutritional value of the portion will be calculated by the program
- user can log out from the system

## Possible future ideas

- user could see what are the most popular foods in the collection
- user could determine daily intake goals for different nutrients
- user could add a new food giving its’ nutritional value
- it would be possible to give recommendations / alert messages when there’s inbalance
  - too little/too much calories per day, too much of one but too little of another nutrient
